Models Data Directory
=====================

This directory contains a representation of the model of various versions of the Wildfly, JBoss EAP and JBoss AS7 application
servers. These diffs are generated against the standalone-full.xml profile for now.

This data allows the Wildscribe pages to be generated offline, without a running server instance. It also means that at some
stage it should be possible to generate diff's of the models.
